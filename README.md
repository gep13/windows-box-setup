# Windows Box Setup

This is an example repository to showcase how [Chocolatey][choco] and
[Boxstarter][box] can be used to bootstrap a Windows machine using a single
`box.zip` artifact. This method relies on the public [Chocolatey][choco] feed,
but can be adapted to any set of custom feeds.

## Development

Install [Chocolatey][choco] and [Boxstarter][box]:

```powershell
. { iwr -useb https://boxstarter.org/bootstrapper.ps1 } | iex; get-boxstarter -Force
```

The `artifacts\box.zip` file can be built by running `build.ps1`.

## Bootstrap a Computer

The packages `my.box.setup` and `my.box.setup.explorer` contain example
instructions to bootstrap a .NET developer environment.

- Copy `box.zip` to a network share or to your target computer.
- Extract the archive and run `install-mybox.ps1`. This command will start a
  local copy of Boxstarter which will install the `my.box.setup` package.
